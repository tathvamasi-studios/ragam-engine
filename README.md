Trying to make a game engine following along the tutorials found here [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx](making_games_with_c++_sdl2)


Also, why is it called `ragam-engine` ?
Coz of nostalgia. Thareeq, Mammali, Surya, Nandu and Febin will know :) 
Also coz we can call it whatever we want
